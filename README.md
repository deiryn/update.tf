# What is this all about?
update.tf is a project created by me (dei) as my own protest for lack of major updates for Team Fortess 2.

# Can I use your code in my projects?
As the license states you can do that and I'll be happy to see how you can make my code better, because I'm not really a pro at writting cool JS, HTML and CSS thingies, like most web devs.

# How can I contact you about things I want to know about?
You can ask me stuff on any social media or email posted on my community profile.
